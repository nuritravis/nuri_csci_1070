1. Plan
I'm working alone. I plan on working on this project for a couple hours every other day or so. I'm going to make general plans (how i should preprocess the data, what kinds of visuals, what methods, etc) before actually coding.

2. Dataset
I'm using data from VCT games 2021-2024 from kaggle. 
It includes statistics about matches, teams, and players from professional Valorant matches.

3. Hypotheses
Null: For the dataset VCT 2021-2024, player statistics will show no difference between player role.
Alternative: For the dataset VCT 2021-2024, there will be a difference in player role according to player statistics.

4. Models
The models that i think may be best for this dataset would be logistic regression, random forest and maybe KNN.
